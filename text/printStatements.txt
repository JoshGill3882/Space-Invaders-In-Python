Print statements are the most basic of scripts. These simply output whatever is in their brackets to the console or output window.
In Python, they are coded by simply putting "print()". Whatever is in the brackets will be outputted.
The beauty of the print statement is that they will output anything including strings, integers, data from variables or even full arrays.
