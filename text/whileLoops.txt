While loops are pieces of code which will run until a specific condition becomes false. At the begininning of each loop, the code checks to see if the condition is true and, if it is, runs the code.
In python, this is written using the script "while" followed by a condition. The functionality of a while loop means that, if the code was to read "while True", the loop would run indefinitely.
