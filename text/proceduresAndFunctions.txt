Procedures and Functions are pieces of code which are defined before the main program and are only activated if called. This means that, if a piece of code is needed at multiple points in the program, it can be placed into a Procedure or Function and then called whenever it is necessary.
Procedures and Functions run slightly differerently, with Procedures not passing any values back into the main program, while Functions pass values back using the "return" piece of code in python.
These items of code are defined using the "def" script followed by the Procedure or Function's name and a set of brackets.
